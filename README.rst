This Python package provides a set of convenient tools we use in the W-Team /
Data to Decisions research group at the Colorado School of Mines.


Getting Started
---------------

``wtools`` is installable using ``pip``. We haven't yet deployed ``wtools``
on PyPI as it is in its very early stages.

To get started using ``wtools``, clone this project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/csmwteam/wtools.git

Then go into that cloned development directory and perform a local installation
via ``pip`` in your active virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd wtools
    $ pip install .

Contributing
------------

Do you want to add features? Then go ahead and make commits to the project and
push them to GitHub and create a Pull Request!

In your virtual environment, make sure you have all of the proper dependancies
installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
